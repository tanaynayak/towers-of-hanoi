    <h2>How to Play Towers of Hanoi</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of the game is to move all the discs from the leftmost tower to the rightmost tower. 
        You can only move one disc at a time, and a larger disc cannot be placed on top of a smaller disc. 
        Click and drag to move a disc to another tower, stacking them from smallest on top to largest on the bottom. 
        Complete the game in the fewest moves possible and see your move count at the top!
